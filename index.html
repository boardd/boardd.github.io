                        Motosports has been something that I have been passionate about for a long time. I created this website to share my interest so that hopefully more people will become fans of the sport.
                        To learn more about the sport and its different forms, click on the "Lean about Motorsports" tab. To see how two popular forms of the sport compare, click on "Compare Motorsports" tab.
                        To ask me a question, click on the "Ask a Question" tab. Lastly, to see which track is my favorite and how you can get there, click on the "Favorite Track" tab.
